Assumptions

1. Email Domain Restriction: Only emails from the domain ".dso.org.sg" can receive OTPs. Other domains are considered invalid.

2. Email Sending Functionality: There is an existing function send_email(email_address, email_body) that handles the actual sending of emails.

3. OTP Format and Validity: The OTP is a 6-digit random number and is valid for 1 minute.

4. User Input for OTP: user input other than 6 digit Generted OTP considered as Invalid OTP. And the user can attempt to enter the OTP up to 10 times before 1 minute.

5. Timeout Handling: If the user does not enter a valid OTP within 1 minute, the process times out.

	Check:
